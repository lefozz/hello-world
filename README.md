# hello-world
Testing how this works<br>
Hi, Ellen here, trying to learn a bit more about coding etc so playing about on this. I have just commited to the #100daysofcode challenge in the hope it will help me commit to keeping on with the freecodecamp curriculum. I finished the first module but became less enthused when working on the Basic Javascript part.
